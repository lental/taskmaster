Taskmaster: Keep your tasks in line!

   Taskmaster is a task-list based application that helps encourage better time management
    for android users.  While the app can act as a simple task manager, its strength comes 
    from its ability to measure how long you take on similar tasks, and leverage this 
    information to help the user spend their time more efficiently in the future. This
    is accomplished through intelligent suggestions about tasks the user can perform at a
    given moment, as well as through displays of statistics about how the user spends their
    time.


System Requirements
   App should run under any Android system running API version 7 or higher, and has been
    tested in the Android Emulator running under Windows 7 and under Mac OS 10.6.4 and 
    using Android API version 7.
